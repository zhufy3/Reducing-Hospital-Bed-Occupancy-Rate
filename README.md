# Description to the project
The project is a group task for the course _Data Science in Business_. We were required to apply data science mindset to a business case. 
Our team decided to focus our attention on a long-existed problem - Bed occupancy of hospital - to predict the bed occupancy rate, so that the hospital management system can 
arrange the resources in advance and relieve the dilemma of the storage of bed for patients.
We innovated to filter out the records that appear at some level of frequency with the help of Frequent Pattern Mining, and then fitted the data with machine learning methods to predict the stay length of a patient.
