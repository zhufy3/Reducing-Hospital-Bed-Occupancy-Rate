# Description to the project
The project is a group task for my post-grad course _Data Science in Business_. We were required to apply data science mindsets to a real business case. 
Our team decided to focus our attention on a long-term-existed problem, Bed occupancy of hospital, to predict the bed occupancy rate, so that the hospital management system can arrange the medical resources in advance and relieve the dilemma of the storage of beds for patients.
We innovated to filter out the records that appear at some level of frequency with the help of Frequent Pattern Mining method, and then fitted the data with machine learning methods to predict the stay length of a patient. We hope that with the assistance of the prediction results and work experiences, the workers in a hospital can schedule the beds of hopital in advance and in a more reasonable way.
